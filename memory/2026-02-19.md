- Stored: Gmail sender address for automated emails: alfred.huber.business@gmail.com
  - Credentials file (secrets) located at: /root/clawd/email/alfred-email.env (file contains app password). Permissions should remain restricted.
- Configured: healthcheck for population.araneo.org (systemd timer + script) and notification plumbing (systemd path/service + clawdbot relay).
- Tag created locally: stable-2026-02-14 (repo snapshot with healthcheck and notifier).

Notes:
- Secrets are NOT duplicated into memory; only a pointer to the credentials file is stored.
- If you want this saved into long-term MEMORY.md, say so and I'll summarize and move selected items there.
